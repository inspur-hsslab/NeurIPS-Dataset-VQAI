# Image Content Generation with Causal Reasoning

This is the official project of the VQAI dataset proposed in: Image Content Generation with Causal Reasoning.

## VQAI Dataset

We propose a task called Visual Question Answering with Image to support research on Image Content Generation with Causal Reasoning. 
In addition, we publicize the eponymous dataset VQAI for this task.
Each sample in the dataset includes an initial and a resultant image, a causal question, with some of them including an annotation of a causal chain. 

All the videos used in the collection of VQAI are sourced from the ***Tom and Jerry*** animated series, which is copyrighted material.
Hence, we follow Fair Use ยง107: *the fair use of a copyrighted work, including such use by ... scholarship, or research, is not an infringement of copyright*, 
where fair use is determined by *the purpose and character of the use, including whether such use is of a commercial nature or is for nonprofit educational purposes*, 
*the amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to the copyrighted work as a whole*, 
and *the effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work.*
Hence, the VQAI datasets are noncommercial and should only be used for the purpose of academic research.
